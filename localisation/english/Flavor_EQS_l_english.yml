 cocopommel_add_tt: "Because of her Manehattan origins, Coco Pommel is being seen as pro-lunarist despite her political neutrality. As such, appointing her will strengthen §BLunarist§! side slightly!" 
 EQS_advisor.4.t: "Arrival from the Megalopolis" #coco
 EQS_advisor.4.d: "Arriving by train from her Manehattan residence, Coco Pommel's heart thundered in her chest as she disembarked at Canterlot Station. She glanced back down against the letter she clutched against her chest; royal seal still attached. An invitation to join the Equestrian government, to work with the civil service and the crown in helping to develop and manage Equestria's industry. She'd never expected to rise this far, always assuming her origins from the seedier parts of Manehattan, not to mention her earth pony nature, would count against her in high society.\n\nShe was pleasantly surprised that Canterlot wasn't anywhere near as bad as she'd feared. Ponies seemed warm and welcoming, and while some did give her odd looks and curious glances as she'd entered the palace, most had been pleasant enough. It wasn't till she'd gotten into the depths of the palace proper, while fidgeting and squirming on her seat in a waiting room, that she noticed the hushed whispers and strained snippets of conversation. Mutterings about her Manehattan background, theories about her being another 'Lunarist' being sent into pad out the administration. She frowned for a moment before composing herself, doing her best to keep her nerves under control as she waited for her appointment with the Princesses.[appoint_cocopommel_diarchy]" # I love your horsewords so much !
 appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_sl: "\n\nCoco would never realise this herself but her appointment had coincided with the arrival of a number of new thestral bureaucrats in the city. Given that Manehattan had been central to Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights, rumours had started to spread that Coco was the unofficial leader of the new Lunarist faction that had started to develop. While the rumours had no basis in reality, their mere existence seems to have emboldened the Lunarist elements at court, comforting them with the false knowledge of widespread support from the wider population."
 EQS_advisor.4.a: "Regardless, She had proved herself."

 EQS_advisor.400.t: "Is Coco a Real Lunarist?" #cocopommel event chain 1
 EQS_advisor.400.d: "hey can you help some lunarist project"
 EQS_advisor.400.a: "lol no"
 EQS_advisor.400.b: "i dunno"
 EQS_adv_400b_tt: "She would continue to avoid this situation, so there will be no change in the balance of power."
 EQS_advisor.400.c: "let's goooo"
 
 flim_flam_add_tt: "they are from las pegas, can strengthen businesspony faction? - then what they be considered as, either sol or lun? I made his setup as bumping lunarist by 5% for now"
 EQS_advisor.5.t: "Art of Business" #flim_flam
 EQS_advisor.5.d: "I cannot imitate their based words damn.[appoint_flim_flam_diarchy]"
 appoint_flim_flam_diarchy_sl: " but they love money." #5% to lunarist
 EQS_advisor.5.a: "how honest those businessbros are"

 EQS_advisor.50.t: "do you love money" #(being fired 333 days after his appointment)
 EQS_advisor.50.d: "hey can you help some our project"
 EQS_advisor.50.a: "lol no, we are honest businesspones" #never leads to scandal
 EQS_adv_50a_tt: "Keeping your hooves §Pclean§! is probably the most important thing you can do to stay in public service."

 eqsdiarchy_advisor_51_troll: "§RBUT WHY?§!" #when you pick option that denouncing side unrelated to flimflam connection, with harmful penalties

 inkwell_add_tt: "Raven Inkwell has served as Princess Celestia's personal assistant for a long time, perhaps appointing her could have strengthened the power of §OSolarists§!?"
 EQS_advisor.6.t: "The Formalized Assistant" #inkwell
 EQS_advisor.6.d: "Raven Inkwell, Princess Celestia's personal assistant, was today formally awarded a position within the reorganised government bureaucracy. Inkwell's appointment marks a high note in the ongoing formalisation of the Equestrian administration, with many adhoc roles being transformed into civil service positions.[appoint_inkwell_diarchy] Inkwell's appointment should help to ensure that Equestria's administration continues to be smoothly run in the years ahead."
 appoint_inkwell_diarchy_sl: " While some have wondered if this appointment would lead to increased biases towards Solarist positions within the administration, Inkwell's lack of public commitment to either faction suggests any such impact will likely be minimal. Regardless,"
 EQS_advisor.6.a: "*boring eldermare reactions*"

 #fancy_pants
 fancy_pants_add_tt: "he bumps solarist by 10%"
 EQS_advisor.7.t: "Based Noble" 
 EQS_advisor.7.d: "Despite the ingrained stereotypes of the upper class and aristocracy, he's a really good guy.[appoint_fancy_pants_diarchy]"
 appoint_fancy_pants_diarchy_sl: " he bumps solarist anyway"
 EQS_advisor.7.a: "*boring eldermare reactions*"

 #filthy_rich
 filthy_rich_add_tt: "he bumps solarist by 5%"
 EQS_advisor.8.t: "Road To Rich" 
 EQS_advisor.8.d: "He is literally rich as his father is. Critics say he's nothing more than a crooked businesspony who only benefits from Lightning Apple Jam, but the money is honest. I don't know how to write this... less boring.[appoint_filthy_rich_diarchy]"
 appoint_filthy_rich_diarchy_sl: " he bumps solarist anyway"
 EQS_advisor.8.a: "*boring eldermare reactions*"

 rarity_add_tt: "Of course she is stil a prominent supporter of Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights."
 EQS_advisor.21.t: "Generosity in Cabinet" #Generosity
 EQS_advisor.21.d: "\"Oh, Canterlot, What you do on me?\"\n\nRarity was very excited to enter the Canterlot Castle. It had been a long time since she had started to manage the Canterlot Carousel, so Canterlot was no longer a strange place to Rarity, in fact, she could almost feel its stagnation, and she had visited the Castle many times before, but this visit was special. [Root.GetLeader] had appointed her to the position of Advisor for Munitions to the High Command. After a brief ceremony, the excitement had lasted til she was ushered into the office and told what she would be doing. It ended by mountains of requirement form for uniform supply which she was confronted with reminding of those she had encountered during the opening of the Canterlot Carousel."
 #appoint_rarity_diarchy_sl: "\n\nOf course she is still a huge supporter of Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights. This meant that she would be caught in the middle of a power struggle between the Two Sisters." #10% to lunarist
 EQS_advisor.21.a: "No dress here's unique." # rules of rarity

 #22 wonderbolts (academy)
 wonderbolts_add_tt: "With the recent political change, many are calling for a change also in the Wonderbolts and thier abilities; will they remain the same as they were?\n\nnote: Appointment event would fire only once, so if you keep having Wonderbolts as one of High Command, you can make choice for it later."
 EQS_advisor.22.t: "Who Dares, Wins"
 EQS_advisor.22.d: "boring description about wonderbolts academy[appoint_wonderbolts_diarchy]"
 appoint_wonderbolts_diarchy_sl: "\n\nWith the recent political change, many are calling for a change also in the Wonderbolts and thier abilities; will they remain the same as they were? now they are demanding for bat quarters; not quota anyways(or yes)"
 EQS_advisor.22.a: "fuck off those bats" #15% to solarist
 EQS_advisor.22.b: "[eqsdiarchy_advisor_22b]"
 eqsdiarchy_advisor_22b_sunbutt: "*boring eldermare reaction for feathered horses*" #when you have no diarchy, adds +10 air exp.
 eqsdiarchy_advisor_22b_diarchy: "Just apply the merit system." #adds additional +5 air exp. (total +15) and reduces night penalty
