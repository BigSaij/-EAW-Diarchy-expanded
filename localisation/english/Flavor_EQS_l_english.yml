 cocopommel_add_tt: "Because of her Manehattan origins, Coco Pommel is being seen as pro-lunarist despite her political neutrality. As such, appointing her will strengthen §BLunarist§! side slightly!" #thank to Roserado
 EQS_advisor.4.t: "Arrival from the Megalopolis" #coco
 EQS_advisor.4.d: "Arriving by train from her Manehattan residence, Coco Pommel's heart thundered in her chest as she disembarked at Canterlot Station. She glanced back down against the letter she clutched against her chest; royal seal still attached. An invitation to join the Equestrian government, to work with the civil service and the crown in helping to develop and manage Equestria's industry. She'd never expected to rise this far, always assuming her origins from the seedier parts of Manehattan, not to mention her earth pony nature, would count against her in high society.\n\nShe was pleasantly surprised that Canterlot wasn't anywhere near as bad as she'd feared. Ponies seemed warm and welcoming, and while some did give her odd looks and curious glances as she'd entered the palace, most had been pleasant enough. It wasn't till she'd gotten into the depths of the palace proper, while fidgeting and squirming on her seat in a waiting room, that she noticed the hushed whispers and strained snippets of conversation. Mutterings about her Manehattan background, theories about her being another 'Lunarist' being sent into pad out the administration. She frowned for a moment before composing herself, doing her best to keep her nerves under control as she waited for her appointment with the Princesses.[appoint_cocopommel_diarchy]" # I love your horsewords so much !
 appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_sl: "\n\nCoco would never realise this herself but her appointment had coincided with the arrival of a number of new thestral bureaucrats in the city. Given that Manehattan had been central to Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights, rumours had started to spread that Coco was the unofficial leader of the new Lunarist faction that had started to develop. While the rumours had no basis in reality, their mere existence seems to have emboldened the Lunarist elements at court, comforting them with the false knowledge of widespread support from the wider population."
 EQS_advisor.4.a: "Regardless, She had proved herself."

 EQS_flim_flam_fire_tt: "§YFlim and Flam§! will §Rno longer be available§! as Political Advisor."

 EQS_advisor.52.t: "Flim-Flam Apprehension" #take that decision
 EQS_advisor.52.d: "they robbed nation's wealth real cheesy, but couldn't hide from Applejack, provisional Chief of the National Audit Office."

 #EQS_advisor.53.t: "Every Evidence Has Been Collected" #if you inspected them; removed because it's out of character for AJ
 #EQS_advisor.53.d: "You can now issue arrest warrant of Flim and Flam, and conclude the corruption at any time. Of course it would be critical damage to [FF_GetSolLun], conspired with Flim and Flam."
 #EQS_advisor.53.a: "I see."

 inkwell_add_tt: "Raven Inkwell has served as Princess Celestia's personal assistant for a long time, perhaps appointing her could have strengthened the power of §OSolarists§!?"
 EQS_advisor.6.t: "The Assistant" #inkwell
 EQS_advisor.6.d: "Raven Inkwell, Princess Celestia's personal assistant, was today formally awarded a position within the reorganised government bureaucracy. Inkwell's appointment marks a high note in the ongoing formalisation of the Equestrian administration, with many adhoc roles being transformed into civil service positions.[appoint_inkwell_diarchy] Inkwell's appointment should help to ensure that Equestria's administration continues to be smoothly run in the years ahead."
 appoint_inkwell_diarchy_sl: " While some have wondered if this appointment would lead to increased biases towards Solarist positions within the administration, Inkwell's lack of public commitment to either faction suggests any such impact will likely be minimal. Regardless,"

 EQS_advisor.21.d: "\"Oh, Canterlot, What you do on me?\"\n\nRarity was very excited to enter the Canterlot Castle. It had been a long time since she had started to manage the Canterlot Carousel, so Canterlot was no longer a strange place to Rarity, in fact, she could almost feel its stagnation, and she had visited the Castle many times before, but this visit was special. [Root.GetLeader] had appointed her to the position of Advisor for Munitions to the High Command. After a brief ceremony, the excitement had lasted til she was ushered into the office and told what she would be doing. It ended by mountains of requirement form for uniform supply which she was confronted with reminding of those she had encountered during the opening of the Canterlot Carousel.[appoint_rarity_diarchy_sl]"

 EQS_advisor.210.a: "\"I'm here to show all that I can give.\""

 EQS_advisor.211.t: "rarity upgrade placeholder"
 EQS_advisor.211.d: "While Rarity hasn't neglected her duties at cabinet, she's also been privately supporting Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights. Now the power struggle between the Two Sisters rises and she's healed from her wounds, she already knows that there are more things to be done, as Princess Luna's campaign is far from over."
